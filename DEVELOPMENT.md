  Flag Raising (red), WS Staff Meeting (purple), US Staff Meeting (violet),
  Tutor Meeting (green), Department Meeting (indigo), SPTC Meeting (cyan),
  Assembly (amber), Parent Meeting (orange), Others (grey)
- Audio is ephemeral (browser memory only) — only transcript and AI summary persist to Supabase
- `useAppData` hook: added meetings state, Supabase sync, `addMeeting`/`updateMeeting`/`deleteMeeting`
- Environment: `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` in `.env.local`

### Phase 13 — Idea Pool Enhancement 灵感池增强 (2026-03-02)
- Idea status expanded from 2-state to 3-state: `note`(只是记录) / `pending`(待处理) / `processed`(已处理)
- Status badge click cycles through states: note → pending → processed → note
- Status badge colors: note=slate, pending=amber, processed=emerald, with Chinese labels

  - Inline editing: click Edit to expand full edit form within the card
  - Manual "New Record" form with all fields (date, class, topic, progress, homework, notes, next plan)
  - Delete with confirmation
- **Auto-record**: `updateTimetableEntry` in `useAppData` now auto-upserts a `LessonRecord` when saving a `type=lesson` entry with topic or notes
  - Key: `date (today) + class_name` — same day + same class updates existing record, new day creates new record
  - Ensures weekly records accumulate without overwriting history
- TimetableEntryForm: added standalone "Topic" input field (previously only in subject)
- TimetableEntryForm: save area shows hint "Saving will auto-record to Lesson Records" for lesson-type entries
- Sidebar: "Lesson Records" entry with FileText icon, placed after Teaching
- `useAppData`: `lessonRecords` state with localStorage persistence, Supabase fetchOrSync, 3 CRUD functions (`addLessonRecord`, `updateLessonRecord`, `deleteLessonRecord`)

### Phase 15 — Password Protection 增强安全性 (2026-03-02)
- LoginGate token format upgraded: plain hash string → JSON `{ hash, timestamp }` with automatic old-format migration
- **7-day session expiry**: token validated against `Date.now() - timestamp < 7 days`; expired tokens auto-cleared on mount
- **AuthContext + useAuth() hook**: React Context exposing `logout()` function to all child components
- **Logout button**: added to both desktop sidebar (below "Current Role" card) and mobile sidebar (bottom of nav)
- Logout clears localStorage token and returns to login screen
- App restructured: split into `App` (LoginGate wrapper) + `AppContent` (inner component consuming auth context)
- **deploy.yml fix**: added missing `VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY` secret to build env (production meeting transcription now works)

### Phase 16 — Missing Views + Settings 全功能设置 (2026-03-02)

  - **About**: app description, tech stack summary, GitHub repo link
- `sidebarConfig.ts`: added Goals (Target icon), School Events (CalendarDays icon), Settings (Settings icon)
- `App.tsx`: imported 5 new components, added `isGoalFormOpen/editingGoal` and `isEventFormOpen/editingEvent` state, 3 new switch cases (`goals`, `events`, `settings`), GoalForm + SchoolEventForm modal renders
- `DashboardView.tsx`: Goals section "View All" → navigates to `'goals'`; School Events "View All" → navigates to `'events'` (was incorrectly pointing to `'timetable'`)

  - WorkLogView: `<table>` wrapped in `<div className="overflow-x-auto">`
- **Drag-and-Drop Timetable** (desktop grid only):
  - Installed `@dnd-kit/core` + `@dnd-kit/utilities`
  - `DndContext` with `PointerSensor` (distance: 8 to prevent click→drag conflict)
  - Inline `DraggableEntry` + `DroppableCell` wrappers around existing entry cards / grid cells
  - `handleDragEnd`: parses droppable ID `{day}-slot-{time}`, preserves entry duration via `timeDiffMinutes()` + `addMinutesToTime()`, calls `onUpdateEntry`
  - Visual feedback: drop target highlights with indigo background, dragged entry shows 50% opacity
- New files: `src/hooks/useDarkMode.ts`, `src/components/GlobalSearch.tsx`
- Modified: 34 files total (914 insertions, 521 deletions)

### Phase 18 — Calendar View 日历视图 (2026-03-02)

  - Loading spinner (`Loader2`), error display, button disabled during generation
- **QuickCapture AI Auto-Categorization**: new "AI" button after category buttons
  - `geminiService.suggestCategorization()`: analyzes note text, returns `{ ideaCategory, ideaPriority, workLogCategory, tags }`
  - Auto-selects suggested category, shows "AI suggested: X" label
  - Min 10 chars required, disabled while loading, silent fail on error, reset on submit
- **Student Weakness Practice Recommendations**: enabled previously disabled "Recommend Practice" button

  - Returns concise Markdown with Diagnosis / Practice Strategy / Quick Win sections
  - Per-weakness loading state, inline rendering with `MarkdownRenderer`, ephemeral results
- **Smart Timetable Conflict Detection**: pure logic, no AI
  - New `src/lib/timetableUtils.ts`: `detectConflicts(entry, allEntries)` → `TimetableConflict[]`
  - Handles recurring vs date-specific matching by day number
  - Default 45-min duration when end_time === start_time (quick-add case)
  - TimetableEntryForm: amber warning box listing conflicts (warning only, not blocking save)
  - CalendarView DaySchedule: pulsing red dot on conflicting entry cards
- New file: `src/lib/timetableUtils.ts`
- Modified: 7 files (429 insertions, 83 deletions)

### Phase 20 — AI Idea Consolidation 智能整合 (2026-03-02)
- **AI Consolidation feature**: select multiple items, AI merges into one structured note, preview & edit, confirm replaces old with new
- Supported across 3 modules: **Ideas**, **Work Logs**, **SOP Library**
- `geminiService.ts`: 3 new Gemini 2.5 Flash methods
  - `consolidateIdeas()`: merges ideas → `{title, content, category, priority}` JSON
  - `consolidateWorkLogs()`: merges logs → `{content, category, tags}` JSON
  - `consolidateSOPs()`: merges SOPs → `{title, content, category}` JSON
- `useAppData.ts`: 3 new state management methods
  - `consolidateIdeas()`, `consolidateWorkLogs()`, `consolidateSOPs()`
  - Each: `Promise.all` delete selected → create merged new item → toast notification
- 3 new preview modal components (purple theme + Sparkles icon):
  - `ConsolidatePreviewModal.tsx` — Ideas: editable title, content (RichTextEditor), category, priority
  - `ConsolidateWorkLogPreviewModal.tsx` — WorkLogs: editable content, category, tags
  - `ConsolidateSOPPreviewModal.tsx` — SOPs: editable title, content, category (select dropdown)
- 3 views updated with selection mode:
  - `IdeasView.tsx`: Select/Exit Select toggle, card checkboxes with purple highlight ring, floating bottom bar
  - `WorkLogView.tsx`: table row checkboxes, conditional column display (hide actions in select mode)
  - `SOPView.tsx`: card checkboxes with purple highlight ring, hide expand/edit/delete in select mode
- Each view: floating bottom bar with selected count + "AI Consolidate" button (enabled at ≥2) + Cancel
- User flow: Select → check items → AI Consolidate → loading → preview modal → edit → Confirm & Replace
- `App.tsx`: wired `onConsolidate` prop for all 3 views
- New files: 3 modal components
- Modified: 5 files (977 insertions, 119 deletions across 2 commits)

### Phase 21 — AI Batch Teaching Data 批量备课数据生成 (2026-03-03)
- **Offline batch generation**: Node.js scripts extract 5 bilingual .docx teaching plans (Year 7–11) and use Gemini 2.5 Flash to generate structured teaching data
- Pipeline: `textutil` (macOS) extracts .docx → Gemini parses document structure → Gemini generates supplementary content per sub-unit
- **Generated content** (55 teaching units, 111 sub-units):
  - Objectives: extracted verbatim from documents (bilingual English + Chinese)
  - **1,575 bilingual vocabulary items** (`{english, chinese}` pairs)
  - **111 classroom exercise sets** (5-8 questions each, with LaTeX math, bilingual instructions)
  - **111 homework sets** (5-6 questions each, slightly harder than classwork)
  - Period estimates per sub-unit (1-4 × 45-min classes)
- **Supabase import**: replaced 55 empty skeleton Year 7–11 units with fully enriched data; Year 12 (17 units) preserved intact; total 72 units
- Technical challenges solved:
  - Proxy-aware API calls via `curl` (Node.js `fetch` doesn't respect `HTTP_PROXY`)
  - LaTeX-in-JSON sanitizer: fixes `\frac`→`\f` (form feed), `\times`→`\t` (tab), `\sqrt`→`\s` (invalid) collisions with JSON escape characters
  - Incremental save per year-group for crash recovery; retry script for failed sub-units
- New files:
  - `scripts/generate-teaching-data.mjs` — main generation script (~59 Gemini API calls)
  - `scripts/retry-failed.mjs` — retry failed sub-units
  - `scripts/import-to-supabase.mjs` — direct Supabase batch upsert (DELETE old + INSERT new)
  - `scripts/output/teaching-units-all.json` — combined output (752KB, import-ready)
- Modified: 0 source files (scripts only, no app code changes)

### Phase 22 — Learning Objectives 教学目标结构化 (2026-03-03)
- **SubUnit objectives upgraded**: `objectives: string[]` → `learning_objectives: LearningObjective[]` structured objects
- Each Learning Objective now has: `id`, `objective` (bilingual text), `status` (not_started / in_progress / completed), `periods`, optional `notes`
- **Backward compatibility**: `normalizeTeachingUnit()` adapter auto-converts old `string[]` data from Supabase/localStorage to new format on load
- **SubUnitForm**: replaced flat text inputs with structured LO cards — each card has objective textarea, status dropdown (3 states), periods number input
- **TeachingView Sub-Unit Detail**: LO cards with color-coded status badges (slate/amber/emerald), click-to-cycle status, progress bar (completed/total)
- **TeachingView Unit Detail**: sub-unit cards show "X/Y LOs" completion progress instead of plain count
- **Class Progress Tracking** (TeachingView + DashboardView): progress calculated from completed LOs across all sub-units (was sub-unit count)
- **AI context**: TimetableEntryForm maps `learning_objectives` to strings for Gemini lesson plan generation
- New files:
  - `src/lib/teachingAdapter.ts` — `normalizeTeachingUnit()` migration adapter
- Modified files (7): types.ts, SubUnitForm.tsx, TeachingView.tsx, DashboardView.tsx, TimetableEntryForm.tsx, teachingService.ts, useAppData.ts
